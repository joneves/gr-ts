## Further notes

Given the extremely limited time I have available this is really is not some of my greatest React code, I'm hoping that your mostly
interested in having something working. There is no validation, bells or whistles. There is also no TypeScript.

I have also paid very little attention to design/css and so the finished article is pretty crude.
